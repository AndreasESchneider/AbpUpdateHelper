# ASP.NET Zero Framework Update Helper

I am a newbie with the ASP.NET Zero framework but it is a pleasure to work with it. 
Updating an existing project to the latest framework version is however very time consuming. 

The intention of this helper is to facilitate and support the update of an existing project 
to the latest framework version. It does not aim to produce a fully migrated project.

It requires a copy of the new and the current 'ASP.NET CORE MVC & jQuery'
framework and, of course, your project. The resulting project files are written into an output folder. Where a manual merge is required I am 
currently using an existing merge tool (e.g. WinMerge).

The helper is 'Work in Progress' and provides as-is. I am working and improving it as the ASP.NET Zero framework is updated.
