# ASP.NET Zero Framework Update Helper

It is a pleasure to work with the ASP.NET Zero framework. Updating an existing project to 
the latest framework version is however very time consuming. 

The intention of this helper is to facilitate and support the update of an existing project 
to the latest framework. 

It does not aim to produce a fully migrated project

It requires a copy of the new and the current (used from your project) 'ASP.NET CORE MVC & jQuery'
framework and, of course, your project. The resulting project files are written into an output folder. 

The helper is 'Work in Progress' and provides as-is.


#### Merge Support

A full automated merge is not possible and it does not give much sense to develope another merge tool. It is much easier to 
implement some of the existing (free and pay) tools:

* CodeCompare 
* WinMerge
* SmartMerge
